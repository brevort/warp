What you can do with my data packs
- Use them in your own worlds and on multiplayer servers
- Make content (streams, videos, etc.) with them
- Reverse engineer the code to learn how it works
- Modify, add, or remove files to adjust things to your gameplay preferences
- Use them in your own modpacks and distribute them (as long as other creators are cool with it)

What you can’t do with my data packs
- Repackage them as-is
- Claim them as your own, even if you modified them
- Anything that would violate Minecraft's EULA--this is a derivative work--including commercial use

Basically, it’d be super cool if you credit me, but you don’t have to. Just don’t claim it’s your own work.
